My brewing companion Frans is starting a micro brewery to be able to make beer for his restaurant. This means he will have to be much more strict with everything. We have been brewing for two years now, and it's time that I go my own way.

That's why I've started "Radley Brewing Co.", this will be the name of my own brews and I'll be bringing on friends and family to do some brews when I feel like it.

To start out I brewed a session IPA yesterday whilst helping Frans to put together the new and really good looking SS Brewing conical 150L fermenter. He's got it going with a box freezer and glycol to be able to cool it down, and some kind of heating pad which you press against the side.

I've got a lot to do in the garage before I'm satisfied, but that is what it's all about isn't it?
